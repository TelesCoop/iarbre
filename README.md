# 🌳 IArbre

Please find a detailled description of the project (in French) on our [webpage](https://iarbre.fr).

## 📁 Project Structure

Here's how the repository is organized:

```
IArbre/
├── back/      # Backend code (Python Django)
├── front/     # Frontend code (Vue.js)
├── static/     # Static webpage (HTML,CSS)
├── deploy/    # Deployment configurations (Ansible)
├── docs/    # Documentation (Markdown)
└── .pre-commit-config.yaml  # Pre-commit hooks configuration
```

### **back/**

This directory contains the backend of IArbre, built using **Django** 🐍.
It processes GIS data to compute land occupancy. Then, they are various Django Apps to compute the indices
(plantability, etc) and run the APIs.

### **front/**

The frontend is built with **Vue.js** 🌟. This mostly handles the map.

### **static/**

Static webpage using **HTML/CSS** 🌐. To give general information about the project.

### **deploy/**

Deployment is handled using **Ansible** 🛠️, making it simple to deploy and manage IArbre on your servers.

### **docs/**

Documentation is using Markdown files and can be build using **Mkdocs** 📚.

### **.pre-commit-config.yaml**

We care about code quality! The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file ensures all contributors adhere to best practices by running automated checks before committing changes.

## 🛠️ Setting Up Pre-Commit

Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install pre-commit**:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. **Install the hooks**:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Run the hooks manually (optional)**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

That's it! Now every time you commit, pre-commit will automatically check your code. 🧹✨
